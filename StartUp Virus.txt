Sorry Viewers But i have modified the comments because i love these lines 

Let's have a look at this *Virus* or u can say *DOS Command*


   The Above Command is So dangerous DOS Commands ,
   these commands are alive also today because,
   Windows have a Command Prompt(CMD) that is Derived Form DOS and Command Prompt is Also the 
   Hands of the Windows(Because it can do anything in your PC with Adminitrater Privillage) and All the Versions of Windows.
 
So be careful with your PC Please Do not use it anywhere far from your Desktop
Because What it does is...
****Your PC will Shutdown on every Startup *but after 100 seconds*.









Let's Understand what we have Created with these commands

shutdown -s  = Shutdown PC Anyway, Because Shutdown Process has Highest Priority in Every Operating
                        Systems.


            -t 100 = The Above Program will Execute after 100 seconds of Startup .
                          The Startup time starts after when you Enter the Password for your Login. 

             -c  "This PC has Been Hacked By A Virus" = This Command will Print a Message that is
                                                                                         
                                                                                         This PC has Been Hacked By A Virus

                                                                                         This Message will only let u know why Shutdown is Done.

    **Things that must be Followed

    1. This is the Exact Place Where you have to place your Batch Script   

    2.The Directory \Mercy(Desiigner)\ Is my PC's User name but in Your PC It will be Changed to yours
        but in my PC my Username is Mercy(Desiigner).
        I mean C:\Users\ THIS PLACE WILL BE FOR PC NAME \AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
       but the rest address will be the same.

   3.The Notepad must be saved with .bat Extension Otherwise it will not Run
